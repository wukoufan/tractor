## Quickstart

    npm install
    npm run build
    ./gradlew run

Go to http://localhost:8080.

## Development

### Backend

The backend is a Java Dropwizard server. The files are in the standard Gradle Java layout, with production files in `src/main/java`. Assets are served from `src/main/resources/assets`. The in-game communications are JSON-serialized messages sent to and received from clients via websocket using the Atmosphere framework.

Run either `./gradlew eclipse` or `./gradlew idea` to setup the project in Eclipse or IntelliJ (respectively), and then run the entry point, `TractorServer.java`.

### Frontend

The frontend is a single-page React app in plain Javascript. The assets live in `client/assets`, self-contained React components live in `client/components`, library code (no React) live in `client/lib`, and the top-level view components live in `client/views`.

To start the dev server, run:

    npm install
    npm run start

Then go to http://localhost:3000. The site will auto-refresh after making any frontend changes.
